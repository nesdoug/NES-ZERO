How to use...

This counts the zeros in a NES file.

Run Zero.py in a command prompt or terminal emulator, and type

    $ python3 6502d.py <path_to_nes_file>

When prompted for input, tell it what bank size (just type 2 if you don't know). It will count the zeros in each bank and give you a rough estimate of empty space in each bank.
